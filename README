“Doing ordinary things extraordinary well” I realized that by helping others is not just a very ordinary thing. You don’t know how much the value of helping the poor like what St. John Baptist De La Salle did, he don’t know when his helping the poor that he is acting a role of a very important thing to the poor. On his journey, God made his mission in an imperceptible way so St. John Baptist de La Salle will not recognize it. So try to turn ordinary things   into extraordinary things well. And I also learned that you must have a goal in your life or motives to keep going on and of course you must have a motivation to achieve success. I also realized that helping others is a mission that God wants us to do. When others need a helping hand, help them because every person needs help even though you are smart, wise or rich. No man is an island. You can’t do the whole thing without others consent or help.
